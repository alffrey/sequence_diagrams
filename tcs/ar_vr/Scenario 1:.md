Scenario 1:
Jane is browsing the custom closets section and looking at the mockups we have set up within our store.
Anne, our in house design specialist, approaches Jane and lets her know about the Augmented Reality feature within TCS Consumer App.
Jane launches the app, goes to the AR section and follows direction to scan a QR code displayed at the mockup.
Looking at the mockup through the phone's camera, the screen displays additional information about the components used in the closet mockup.
Jane can use the options within the app to view the mockup in different colors and material choices.
There are links on the screen to lead her to the corresponding Product Detail Page to access additional information.
Though she is not currently in the market for a custom closet, she did find the recommendations around drawer organizers and boot shape holders useful and added them to her cart that day.
Scenario 2:
Anne has invited Tom and Nancy to our Custom Design Center to view their custom space in Virtual Reality.
Anne has already gathered the details regarding the size of the space and requirements during the in-home design consultation.
The custom space was built within our 3D-Design tool and rendered in the Virtual Reality App.
Tom and Nancy don the Oculus headsets provided in the store. They view and interact with their custom space in Virtual Reality.
Tom and Nancy are pleased with the design and provide feedback on a few changes. Anne takes note of these to be included in their design.
The updated 3D design is sent over to Tom and Nancy the same evening. They view it in our 3D design tool on their laptop in a browser, approve it and proceed with the order.
Scenario 3:
Melissa is a DIY enthusiast and has created her own design in our 3D Design tool.
She sees the option to experience her custom space in Virtual Reality in our Custom Design Center.
She books an appointment and provides her custom space design id.
Anne greets Melissa when she shows up for her appointment a few days later.
Melissa's design has been rendered in Virtual Reality by the design team.
She dons the Oculus headsets provided in the store and interacts with her custom space in Virtual Reality.
Anne helps Melissa convert her custom design into a order. All the individual components are added to her cart. The order is placed to be shipped to Melissa's home.
